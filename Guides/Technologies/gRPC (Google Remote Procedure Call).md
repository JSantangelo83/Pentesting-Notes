*It's a Google server that allows remote procedures methods calls*

You can enumerate it's services:
`grpcurl -plaintext $tip:<port> list`

Then call them like (look `tldr grpcurl`):
`grpcurl -v -plaintext $tip:<port> <service>.<method>`

You can enumerate it's objects using describe:
`grpcurl -plaintext $tip:<port> describe <service/object>`


There is a webtool named `grpcui` (`/home/js/go/bin/grpcui`) that allows interact with the gRPC server in a simpler way. (You can perform an SQLi attack using this + burpsuite)
