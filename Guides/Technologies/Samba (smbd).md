**enum4linux**  ^28cd87
- An enum script that extracts most of the important data from the server
- Most of the enum part is all done by running that script.

**smbclient**
- A console-based client to interact with the server
- I can look for shared files, maybe there is something useful:
	- `smbclient $tip -N`
	- Then i can use ftp syntax
- If the samba version matches and there is some writable directory i can have RCE (sambaCry)
