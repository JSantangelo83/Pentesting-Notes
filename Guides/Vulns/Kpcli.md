**Strace** ^9f060a
- Sometimes, if a `strace` command is launched while someone is using the binary, the read syscalls can reveal the data
	- `strace -e read -p $(ps aux | grep kpcli | awk '{print $2}') | grep read(0 | grep '= 1' | tr -d '\n'` 
		- The idea of that command is to get all the syscalls made by the kpcli binary
			- I grep for `read(0` because that's the Standard input (STDI)
			- I grep for `= 1` because that mean's that the call was successful
- The outputs are in ascii format, so:
	-  The `\10` means `delete`
	- The `\n` means `enter`
