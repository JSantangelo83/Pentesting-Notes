**Python String Format Vuln**
- If the code uses a formatted string with an input that could be manipulated i basically have a breakpoint in the code (with only access to the variables passed in the format)
- Example:
	- `"Good day" + username + "{msgs.gree}".format(msgs)`
		- In that case if i have control over `username`, i can make it value something like:
			- `{msgs.__init__.__global__[<some_variable>]}`
			- Having access to the Src code data might be very useful in some cases
				- *Im not sure if i can execute commands, but i think that i cannot*
